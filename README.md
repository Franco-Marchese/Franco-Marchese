### Thanks for reading this.

Currently i am learning a bunch of technologies that i have researched as some essentials in
my way to the *web and mobile development*.

Although my goals now could be very narrow, i hope they put me in a solid base to continue developing solutions to simplify process in 
everyday life to people, with an *effective* treat of the information. :star:
